You are working on a Python project that requires you to manage and manipulate a list of numbers. Your task is to create a Python program that demonstrates the following list operations:
list=[10,20]
a=30
list.append(a)
print(list)
list.pop(1)
print(list)
list.remove(10)
print(list)
i=[5,8,9,15,30,89]
print(sorted(i))
print("the mimimum value is :",min(i))
print("the maximum value is :",max(i))
print("the sum is:",sum(i))
print("the average is:",((sum(i)/len(i))))
